	abstract = {Big Data Analytics is a topic fraught with both positive and negative potential. Big Data is defined not just by the amount of information involved but also its variety and complexity, as well as the speed with which it must be analyzed or delivered. The amount of data being produced is already incredibly great, and current developments suggest that this rate will only increase in the near future. Improved service should result as companies better understand their customers, but it is also possible that this data will create privacy problems. Thus, Big Data is important not only to students who hope to gain employment using these techniques and those who plan to use it for legitimate research, but also for everyone who will be living and working in the 21st Century.},

@inproceedings{araya_compressed_2019,
	abstract = {We introduce an efficient approach that aims at supporting content-based queries on the Chilean Virtual Observatory. In particular we are interested in retrieving relevant information from virtual-observatory tables. This introduces several challenges that make the information-retrieval process harder. We define an algorithm that uses a compressed data structure to obtain the count of the number of occurrences of a string query within each column of a table. This kind of query has been used in the literature for faceted and semantic search as well as for retrieving information from web tables. This is in order to improve search effectiveness. We show that using only 15\%-25\% the space of a table our approach contains the table data (and hence the table can be deleted) and is able to answer queries efficiently in a few milliseconds.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a short survey on the astronomical Virtual Observatories (VOs) that are part of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). From how they are distributed worldwide to their specialization range on the electromagnetic spectrum, we summarize key aspects of the current 21 VO members. Through the registry service, we explore the resources that the VO offer as a whole, and identify that even though the VO is already a mature initiative, there are important challenges to address in the near future.},

@article{araya_content-aware_2020,
	abstract = {VO-services and online astronomical archives in general allow to discover data resources based on the metadata that each resource provides. Content-aware data discovery is the process of searching for patterns within the content of the resources, for example over the values of astronomical catalogs, and returning how many matches each resource produces. While a combination of existing protocols and services might produce this result, scaling up to a large number of resources while maintaining reasonable query speeds is a challenging problem. We propose using succinct representations to produce compressed intermediate files where these queries can be performed with low computational complexity. In particular, we focus on tabular data resources (i.e. catalogs), where a content-aware query can be casted as an attribute-retrieval problem. We show that these intermediate files can be computed directly from VOTable results from TAP services, so a succinct (and compressed) representation of any catalog available over this standard can be obtained. We compare our results with standard SQL queries over a popular DBMS, showing that for most of the queries our approach outperforms the state of the art.},

@inproceedings{solar_chilean_2015,
	abstract = {This paper presents the challenges, architecture and current status of the Chilean Virtual Observatory (ChiVO), which is a software infrastructure for accessing and processing astronomical data generated in Chile. As ChiVO is part of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), we strictly follow the protocols and standards that this organization produce. However, there are always open challenges due to the new observational technologies and local requirements that motivates research on every new virtual observatory, such as the complex data models and Big Data problems that the ALMA Observatory is confronting. The current ChiVO prototype includes IVOA compliant services as well as new solutions designed for ALMA data, all of them using modern software technologies.},
